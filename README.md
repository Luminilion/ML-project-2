## Organisation

There are three folders : `data`, `src` and `plot`

## Recreate final solution

Run in the terminal (while CWD is inside `/src/`):

```
python run.py
```

Then the result should be in the `data` file in `sample-submission.csv`. The `train.csv` and `test.csv` are expected to be unzipped and in the `/data/` folder.
